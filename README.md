# HTML5Wiki
A Wiki based on the Content Editable concept. 

#How it works

This wiki isn't like most. In fact this isn't a invention of any sort. I am taking the Content editable tag, and then adding a few lines of js to make it editable and saved. 

This can make public resources easy to edit. 

#What it can and can't do 

It can - Edit and save changes to pages. 

It can't - Create new ones at this time. 

It can - be used as a component to create a full-featured wiki. 

Formatting is not available just yet.
